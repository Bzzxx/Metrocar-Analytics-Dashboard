# Metrocar Analytics Dashboard
SQL + Tableau Analytics Project

# Project Overview

This project analyzes the Metrocar ride-sharing platform using SQL for data analysis and Tableau for visualization.

All metrics were calculated directly in the database using PostgreSQL, with queries executed via DBeaver.
The final insights are presented in an interactive Tableau dashboard🔗 **[Metrocar Dashboard – Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anastasiia.bzhelenko/viz/Project_metrocar/MetrocarDashboard)**
